## Workflow & Commands

#### Commands like `git status`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git add` regulate and help with orginization and workflow of code. Here is what each one means and how to use them:

 `git status` is a command that shows the current state of your stageing directory. `git status` can be used anytime you want to check if your files are staged or unstaged.

 `git add` is a command that adds either a specific file or all files to the stageing directory. This command is used when you want to save changes to your file and is a 2-step command with `git commit` being the other one.

 `git commit` is a command that saves your file to the local repository. It is also like updating a new version of the file and you can add a note in the command: `git commit -m "_____"`. This command can be used when you want to save your changes to a file and is the 2nd step in the 2-step saving.

`git push` is a command that uploads your local repository to a remote one. This command is used when you want up load your local repository that is using git to the remote one which is github.
